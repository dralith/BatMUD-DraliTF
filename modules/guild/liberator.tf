Ghost slash
You swing and miss your mark!

You swing your two-handed sword in an average arc and hit Thornton Quincey. You swing around and
    quickly strike again, hitting decently. The opportunity presents itself and you kick your opponent,
    causing slight bruises. Ghost of Hans whispers 'This is for my children!' and strikes at Thornton

    last time at your hated enemy, scoring a weak hit.
